## Hackathon Intro (PR Issue)

### **Team name**

Team#12: FluidDAO

### **Product direction**

DAO, NFT, Polygon, SuperFluid, Chainlink

### **Introduction**

<!-- Introduce your product in detail, including what problems are you going to solve, what highlight techs you are using, what values it will bring, etc. -->

- Awkward Situation of DAO:
  - Supervise of the project after sponsorship
  - Fund utilization and security after fundraising
- Highlight Techs we are using:
  - Layer2: Polygon, we build our project on Polygon.
  - SuperFluid - Core component, wrap the DAO token and donate/vote in a period like fluid flow
  - ChainLink - as the price service
- What values we want to bring:
  - This is a dao with controllable fund flow powered by SuperFluid.
  - We are using funding flow NFT(powered by SuperFluid) to provide wrapped DAO Token as the governance token in a DAO's activity period.
  - Currently we only provide one DAO strategy that is 'Donating and Selection', so we using Chainlink to provide price service for Token Value Estimating.
